Sea turtle swims forward using graceful flipper-powered swimming motion, mermaid strikes with trident while maintaining mermaid tail form, or sea turtle rams enemies with its shell using swimming motion.

Coral Rooks: towers unleash magical water attacks or sea creature swarms. Dolphin Pawns: dolphin attacks - swift swimming strikes or propelling forward with snout strikes. Pirate Captain (Black King): cutlass strikes with precision, or calls down cannon fire from ship. Pirate Queen (Black Queen): dual cutlass attacks, or commands ship weapons.
