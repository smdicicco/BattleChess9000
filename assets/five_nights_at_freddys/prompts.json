  "board_desc": "A dimly lit Freddy Fazbear's Pizza restaurant floor. The dark squares are shadowy corners and ventilation grates showing glimpses of dark vents and mechanical systems underneath, with flickering emergency lighting creating an eerie atmosphere. The light squares are worn, checkered red-and-white tile flooring typical of a 1980s family pizzeria, with scuff marks, faded colors, and the occasional pizza grease stain. The back rows (rows 1 and 8) feature the main stage area with curtained backgrounds and spotlight positions where the animatronics perform. The middle rows (2-7) show the main dining area floor. Top-down orthographic view, atmospheric horror lighting with deep shadows, photorealistic textures, 8k resolution. The overall mood should be tense and unsettling, like the security camera view from the games.",

  "anim_desc": "Five Nights at Freddy's style captures - tense, horror-themed but not gory, mechanical and psychological horror. Animations feel like security camera footage or jumpscare moments. White pieces (animatronics) capture with mechanical precision - grabbing, pulling into shadows, or malfunctioning to disable. Black pieces (security/night guard) capture using flashlights causing glitches/shutdowns, security doors slamming, or camera flashes causing failures. Freddy (White King) approaches menacingly, grabs pulling into darkness, or uses microphone as weapon. Chica (White Queen) lunges with cupcake or beak opens wide. Bonnie (White Bishops) strums guitar causing shockwave/glitch or grabs. Foxy (White Knights) sprints with hook grab pulling into shadows. Stage Rooks: curtains close or stage \"swallows\" into machinery. Animatronic Pawns: jumpscare lunges or mechanical grabs. Night Guard (Black King): bright flashlight causes glitches, sparks, shutdown. Security System (Black Queen): lockdown - doors slam, lights flash. Security Cameras (Black Bishops): red lights freeze and power down animatronics. Vent Crawlers (Black Knights): emerge from vents dragging into ventilation. Security Doors (Black Rooks): slam shut with crushing force. ROYALTY: White King/Queen ATTACKING: epic malfunctions - eyes glow red, jaw opens unnaturally, mechanical parts extend. White King/Queen DYING: sparks fly, servos grind, collapse in broken parts, eyes flicker out. Black King/Queen ATTACKING: security systems activate - emergency lights flash, alarms, lockdown. Black King/Queen DYING: system fails - cameras dark, doors jam, lights flicker and die. All animations equal length (3-5 seconds), dim security-camera lighting, high-detail textures with wear/rust, psychological/mechanical horror focus. Tense, atmospheric, unsettling tone matching FNAF universe."
