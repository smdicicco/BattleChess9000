  "board_desc": "\"An ultra-premium 8\u00d78 chessboard perfectly centered in frame, shown in strict orthographic top-down view so every square is fully visible, unobstructed, and game-accurate. The board itself takes up most of the image, with a thin margin around it. The light squares are luminous Arc Reactor glass panels with subtle blue circuitry glowing beneath the surface; the dark squares are cracked voidstone obsidian infused with faint purple cosmic veins. Each square is perfectly aligned, crisp, and easy to read for gameplay.Outside the edges of the board, in the background only (never overlapping or covering any squares), the environment expands into a cinematic battlefield: behind the white home rank rises a sleek, MCU-inspired Avengers-style tower on a New York City skyline, lit with cool blue and white lights; behind the black home rank, far in the distance, sits a massive, ominous cosmic throne on a shattered asteroid plateau floating in deep space, surrounded by swirling nebulae and scattered debris. Along the far left and right edges of the frame, you can see hints of New York skyscrapers and city lights blending into the cosmic sky, but they always stay outside the main board area.Lighting is dramatic but functional: soft rim-lighting around the board edges, gentle reflections on the Arc Reactor glass squares, and a subtle cosmic glow from above. Resolution is ultra-sharp, 8k, photorealistic, with a faint aura of Infinity-Stone-style energy pulsing along the grid lines \u2014 but the 8\u00d78 board remains perfectly clean, flat, readable, and never obstructed by any background elements.\"",
  "piece_desc": "\"Each piece can use their own unique standard typical colour pallette the white pieces don't have to be white and the black pieces dont have to be black. For example use black widows black leather with red sting effect on wrists. Always display the full body of the piece from head to toe centered and only 1 character model asset not the left and right views.. Each chess piece is a hyper-detailed sculpture, crafted with the precision and dramatic style of a premium Todd McFarlane action figure. Every character stands on a simple, clean, circular museum-style display base \u2014 matte black for white-side heroes, polished silver for black-side villains. The base is the ONLY part that resembles a chess piece: no crowns, no knight heads, no traditional silhouettes. Every figure is posed heroically in a dynamic, story-driven stance that reflects their personality and combat style. Rendering Style: Premium studio collectible photography. Ultra-sharp, micro-detail sculpting. High-end materials. Dramatic rim lighting. Soft volumetric bounce. Slight depth-of-field blur. No reflections or highlights that obscure the character\u2019s face or armor. White pieces must always be photographed on a dark/black background. Black pieces must always be photographed on a light/white background. WHITE SIDE \u2014 THE AVENGERS KING \u2014 Captain America A heroic, battle-weathered statue of a super-soldier standing proud with shield raised.

KNIGHT \u2014 Thor - Powerful stance with enchanted hammer/axe hybrid resting on shoulder. Storm-like lightning veins glow faintly through skin and armor. Cape flows in sculpted mid-motion. Base crackles with faint lightning arcs. ROOK \u2014 Hulk - Massive, heavy statue with hyper-defined musculature. Skin texture includes pores, scars, veins, and subtle gamma radiance. Jaw clenched, roaring. Cracked stone debris sculpted on base to emphasize power. PAWN \u2014 Hawkeye - Lean, precise archer stance. Bow drawn with a glowing tech-arrow nocked. Tactical armor finely detailed with pockets, straps, and layered Kevlar textures. Minimal, clean composition for easy repeatability across pawns. BLACK SIDE \u2014 THE VILLAINS -KING \u2014 Red Skull - A sinister, commanding figure in a dark uniform with arcane sigils etched into the sculpt.

  "anim_desc": "\"multi cut, cinematic battle animation MASTER ANIMATION ENGINE RULES: The character on the LEFT ALWAYS wins. The character on the RIGHT ALWAYS dies. This is absolute, non-negotiable, and applies to every matchup with no exceptions, no reversals, no alternate endings. The left character must always overpower, defeat, and ultimately destroy the right character. The right character must always fall, collapse, overload, shatter, disintegrate, explode, or otherwise be visibly destroyed in the final cut. You are always animating two specific character models taken from the board\u2014never regenerate, redesign, or replace them with generic versions. Every scene is broken into 3\u20134 cuts: Cut 1 establishes tension, stance, power-up, or approach. Cut 2 shows the clash with rapid exchanges, dodges, blocks, weapon use, and powers. Cut 3 is the finisher where the left side delivers the decisive final blow that kills the right side. Cut 4 is optional aftermath showing the victor standing over the defeated body with smoke, sparks, fractured energy, or debris. The camera style is always dynamic and cinematic\u2014never flat\u2014with orbiting shots, push-ins, tracking across the board, low-angle hero framing, overhead chaos shots, and debris flythroughs. The board may crack, explode, ripple with energy, or collapse in places, but the two characters must remain clearly visible at all times. NEMESIS DUEL RULE: If both pieces are the same type except kings (Pawn vs Pawn, Knight vs Knight, Rook vs Rook, Bishop vs Bishop, Queen vs Queen), trigger Nemesis Duel mode with intensified back-and-forth exchanges, more destruction, more cuts, and a final rivalry kill\u2014still with the left character winning. ROYALTY DEATH RULE: If the right side piece is a King or Queen (heroic leader, machine overlord, stealth operative, arcane warlord), trigger a Royalty Death featuring slow-motion fractures, dramatic lighting bursts, collapsing power fields, armor or weapon breakage, and a clear final downfall\u2014still with the left character victorious. CHECKMATE FINAL BOSS RULE: If the right side piece is a King, the scene escalates into a Final Boss Finisher with maximum visual effects, elemental surges, terrain shaking, slow-motion impacts, and an epic victory pose from the left character. CHESS LEGALITY RULE: A King can never capture a King. Any king-vs-king scenario is invalid and must never be generated. PIECE MAPPING: White side Avengers have King Captain America, Queen Black Widow, Bishop Iron Man, Knight Thor, Rook Hulk, Pawn Hawkeye. Black side Villains have King Red Skull, Queen Ultron, Bishop Thanos, Knight Loki, Rook Abomination, Pawn Kingpin. Use all the following matchups as guidance, always with the left character winning and the right character dying. WHITE ATTACKS BLACK: Captain America versus Ultron Queen Royalty Death. Ultron fires cutting beams while drones swarm. Cap ricochets his shield through drones, then sprints in and drives it straight through Ultron\u2019s core so sparks and wires explode as Ultron drops in slow motion. Captain America versus Thanos Bishop. Thanos throws heavy energy-powered punches as the camera tracks sideways. Cap dodges, sends the shield in a wide rebounding arc, then leaps and slams it into Thanos\u2019 throat, dropping him in a shockwave. Captain America versus Loki Knight. Illusions circle as the camera spins. Cap identifies the real Loki, blocks a staff strike with his shield, uppercuts him, and finishes with a brutal shield bash that breaks the staff and drops Loki lifeless. Captain America versus Abomination Rook. Abomination smashes the board. Cap rolls under a massive swing, ricochets the shield off debris and the monster\u2019s jaw, then charges and delivers a final shield-edge strike that drops Abomination in a board-cracking collapse. Captain America versus Kingpin Pawn. Kingpin advances with heavy steps. Cap parries with his shield, unleashes rapid body blows, then hooks the shield across Kingpin\u2019s jaw, spinning him down instantly. White Queen versus Black King Final Boss plus Royalty Death.
