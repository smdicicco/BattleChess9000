  "board_desc": "\"An ultra-premium 8\u00d78 chessboard perfectly centered in frame, shown in strict orthographic top-down view so every square is fully visible, unobstructed, and game-accurate. The board itself takes up most of the image, with a thin margin around it. The light squares are luminous Arc Reactor glass panels with subtle blue circuitry glowing beneath the surface; the dark squares are cracked voidstone obsidian infused with faint purple cosmic veins. Each square is perfectly aligned, crisp, and easy to read for gameplay.Outside the edges of the board, in the background only (never overlapping or covering any squares), the environment expands into a cinematic battlefield: behind the white home rank rises a sleek, MCU-inspired Avengers-style tower on a New York City skyline, lit with cool blue and white lights; behind the black home rank, far in the distance, sits a massive, ominous cosmic throne on a shattered asteroid plateau floating in deep space, surrounded by swirling nebulae and scattered debris. Along the far left and right edges of the frame, you can see hints of New York skyscrapers and city lights blending into the cosmic sky, but they always stay outside the main board area.Lighting is dramatic but functional: soft rim-lighting around the board edges, gentle reflections on the Arc Reactor glass squares, and a subtle cosmic glow from above. Resolution is ultra-sharp, 8k, photorealistic, with a faint aura of Infinity-Stone-style energy pulsing along the grid lines \u2014 but the 8\u00d78 board remains perfectly clean, flat, readable, and never obstructed by any background elements.\"",
  "piece_desc": "\"Each piece can use their own unique standard typical colour pallette the white pieces don't have to be white and the black pieces dont have to be black. For example use black widows black leather with red sting effect on wrists. Always display the full body of the piece from head to toe centered and only 1 character model asset not the left and right views.. Each chess piece is a hyper-detailed sculpture, crafted with the precision and dramatic style of a premium Todd McFarlane action figure. Every character stands on a simple, clean, circular museum-style display base \u2014 matte black for white-side heroes, polished silver for black-side villains. The base is the ONLY part that resembles a chess piece: no crowns, no knight heads, no traditional silhouettes. Every figure is posed heroically in a dynamic, story-driven stance that reflects their personality and combat style. Rendering Style: Premium studio collectible photography. Ultra-sharp, micro-detail sculpting. High-end materials. Dramatic rim lighting. Soft volumetric bounce. Slight depth-of-field blur. No reflections or highlights that obscure the character\u2019s face or armor. White pieces must always be photographed on a dark/black background.

  "anim_desc": "\"multi cut, cinematic battle animation MASTER ANIMATION ENGINE RULES: You are always animating two specific character models taken from the board. Never regenerate, redesign, or replace them with generic versions. The character on the LEFT always wins. The character on the RIGHT always dies. This is a chess capture. Use each character primary weapons, powers, abilities, and physical style so every fight feels specific and authentic. always broken into 3 to 4 cuts: Cut 1 establish tension, stance, power up, or approach. Cut 2 clash with rapid exchanges, dodges, blocks, and weapon use. Cut 3 finisher with a brutal, decisive final blow that kills the right character. Cut 4 aftermath optional with the victor standing over the defeated body with smoke, sparks, or lingering energy. Camera style is dynamic and cinematic, never flat theatre stage. Use orbiting moves, push ins, tracking across the board, low angle hero shots, overhead chaos shots, and debris flythroughs. The board and environment may crack, explode, or shower debris, but the two characters must always remain clearly visible. The death of the right side character must be final. They fall, are crushed, disintegrate, explode, are impaled, or are otherwise clearly destroyed. NEMESIS DUEL RULE: If both pieces are the same type except kings, for example Pawn versus Pawn, Knight versus Knight, Rook versus Rook, Bishop versus Bishop, Queen versus Queen, trigger Nemesis Duel mode with more intense back and forth, more cuts and camera movement, more destruction and damage, and a final blow that feels like a long rivalry kill. ROYALTY DEATH RULE: If the right side piece is a King or Queen, that is Captain America, Red Skull, Black Widow, or Ultron, trigger a Royalty Death with slow motion moments, visible cracks in armor, shields, or weapons, a dramatic collapse, and strong lighting and energy bursts at the moment of death. CHECKMATE FINAL BOSS RULE: If the right side piece is a King, Captain America or Red Skull, this is a checkmate kill and you trigger a Final Boss Finisher with maximum visual effects, environment shaking impact, cosmic or elemental surges, slow motion final hit, and an epic victory pose. CHESS LEGALITY RULE: A King can never capture a King. If both pieces are kings, that scenario is invalid and must never be generated. PIECE MAPPING: White side Avengers have King Captain America, Queen Black Widow, Bishop Iron Man, Knight Thor, Rook Hulk, Pawn Hawkeye. Black side Villains have King Red Skull, Queen Ultron, Bishop Thanos, Knight Loki, Rook Abomination, Pawn Kingpin. Use the following matchups as guidance, always with the left character winning and the right character dying. WHITE ATTACKS BLACK: Captain America versus Ultron Queen Royalty Death. Ultron fires cutting beams while drones swarm. Cap ricochets his shield through drones, then sprints in and drives it straight through Ultrons chest reactor so sparks and wires explode as Ultron drops in slow motion. Captain America versus Thanos Bishop. Thanos throws heavy Infinity powered punches as the camera tracks sideways. Cap dodges, sends the shield in a wide arc that rebounds off the environment, then leaps and slams it into Thanos throat, sending the titan crashing backward in a shockwave. Captain America versus Loki Knight. Illusions of Loki circle as the camera spins. Cap reads the real Loki movement, blocks a staff strike with his shield, uppercuts him, and finishes with a brutal shield bash that snaps the staff and drops Loki lifeless. Captain America versus Abomination Rook. Abomination smashes the board and shatters tiles. Cap rolls under a massive swing, bounces the shield off broken stone and the monster jaw, then charges and delivers a final shield edge strike that cracks Abomination skull and drops him. Captain America versus Kingpin Pawn. Kingpin advances with heavy steps and raised cane. Cap parries with his shield, unleashes rapid body blows, then hooks the shield across Kingpin jaw so hard he spins and collapses. Black Widow versus Red Skull King Final Boss plus Royalty Death.
