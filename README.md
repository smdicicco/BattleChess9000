##### Prompts used for base medieval version:

Theme Title (folder name) [default: obsidian_gothic]: 

medieval_classic

Board Style [default: obsidian and white m...]: 

Medeival 1600s castles with white marble and black obsidian as classical a chessboard you can make with these matierals at the time. Do NOT display pieces just the board and its polished matierals of marble and black obsidian

Piece Style [default: animated stone statu...]: 

"These are chess pieces in a set. Do not deviate from classic chess pieces but be creative. The Pawns should be peasants or orcs not just chess pawns. As with the rest of the pieces. 1600s medieval European style with White as holy good and Black as gothic evil, showing a noble crowned king, regal robed queen, Catholic bishops with mitres, armored knights on warhorses, fortified stone castle rooks, and simple foot-soldier pawns for White, versus a dark overlord king with spiked crown, sinister robed queen, corrupted plague-priest bishops, skeletal or demonic knights on shadow steeds, dragon-tower rooks with infernal accents, and ragged disposable pawns for Black, all rendered individually in hand-painted medieval illustration style with clear chess silhouettes, high detail, dramatic shading, parchment background, 1:1 aspect ratio, and consistent lighting. IMPORTANT use highly detailed white marble with gold accents for white pieces and black obsidian with dark silver accents for black pieces. They should be highly detailed and look like they were carved from those materials and polished to a high shine. DO NOT MAKE CARTOONS"

Animation Style [default: violent shattering, ...]: 

"Create ultra-violent Excalibur-1980-style medieval fantasy battle animations showing chess pieces as armored warriors made of metal, bone, and enchanted stone brutally hacking, cleaving, crushing, and shattering each other during captures—for example pawns hacking down pawns, knights impaling pawns, rooks smashing queens, bishops cleaving rooks—rendered with hyper-stylized metallic blood-spray, glowing runic energy bursts, slow-motion sword impacts, shattered armor fragments, fog-soaked battle lighting, heavy chromatic bloom, mythic brutality, and the dark, operatic, blood-drenched tone of John Boorman’s Excalibur.IMPORTANT ALWAYS source the characters from the images do not change their appearance or style. These are medieval fantasy chess pieces NOT generic fantasy characters. DO NOT make cartoons or low detail images. Use highly detailed realistic textures and lighting. DO NOT use modern weapons or technology. ONLY the weapons the piece is holding."
